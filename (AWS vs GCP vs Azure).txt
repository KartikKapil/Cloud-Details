Comparison between the top 3 gaints (AWS vs GCP vs Azure)

Virtual Machines

Aws => Virtual machines running in Amazon Web Services are called Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. You can select EC2 instances with preconfigured settings or configure virtual hardware settings manually.

Azure => One of the main advantages of Azure virtual machines is that they use real processor cores.Not like AWS and GCP which use hyperThreading.VMs in Azure show better performance.

Google Cloud => It does not offer wide range of VMs compared to Aws and Azure 

Conclusion => Azure is the best for running various virtual machines 

Container Support 

Aws => Provides Amazon Elastic Containere Registry,Amazon Elastic kubernetes service.Its resource pool is slighty smaller than that of GCP.

Azure => Only has two container Services, The docker hub and azure container registry is used.

Google Cloud => As google played an important role in developing Kubernetes it has the best support for the same. Also the container deployed are highly scalable.

Conclusion => GCP is the best for running and scaling containerized application.

Storage 

Aws => With options like S3 and EBS ,Aws can store and serve static data faster than the other two vendors.Storage can be expanded almost instantaneously.

Azure => Azure Files is a universal storage service to share files with virtual machines running in Azure and local machines running on-site.Good for storing NOSQL databases.

Google Cloud => Usage of persistent disk makes it easier to connect with kubernets.Exporting data is easy.

Conclusion => AWS is best for storing and serving static files when compared to the two follwed by GCP.

Network Services 

Aws => AWS core networking services use an internal architecture called a virtual private cloud (VPC), which is a completely isolated logical network.

Azure =>  The internal architecture of Azure networks is closer to the traditional network architecture of data centers and private networks. Azure Virtual Networking (VNet) is Microsoft’s core cloud network product.

Google Cloud =>  Google uses the Andromeda architecture for networking. This is Google’s network virtualization stack.

Conclusion => Load balancing is best done by AWS and Google Cloud with Google clouds CDN being more user friendly.

Database 

AWS => AWS provides the broadest range of database options. Solutions work with high performance, innovations are implemented on time, and traditional database technologies are available.

Azure => Azure provides great support for migration, including migration assessment, automation, and optimization. There are flexible deployment options, licensing options, and hybrid deployment is available.

Google Cloud => Database services in Google Cloud are the most user-friendly and provide the best performance for workloads. Google offers excellent capabilities to use databases with containers in Google Cloud.

Conclusion => GCP is prefered for microservice architecture as it integrates most easily.
